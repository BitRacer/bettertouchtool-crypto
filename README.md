# To Install

1. Download and install [Better Touch Tool](https://www.boastr.net/downloads/). It allows you to modify your touch bar and other cool things. It's a 45-day trial but "pay what you like" to keep.
2. Right-click and download this file [crypto-krunkosaurus.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krunkosaurus/bettertouchtool-crypto/master/crypto-krunkosaurus.json) to your desktop.
3. In your Mac's menu bar, click the Better Touch Tool icon > Preferences
4. In the bottom right corner of the popup go to "Manage Presets". 
5. Click the "Import" button and select the `crypto-krunkosaurus.json` file you downloaded. Viola you're done!

# Customization

- In the Better Touch Tool preferences panel, you can add, delete, and rearrange the currencies.
- Timing: Currently each currency is refreshed every 60 seconds. Change this by going to Better Touch Tool preferences panel, clicking on a currency, going to "advanced configuration", and adjusting the "run script every x seconds" amount. It's not recommended to go under 30 seconds or the server could ban you.
